## Overview
### Description
Pickup app, groups can post a synopsis about who they are, what sport, where, when, intensity, a short bio then the app has search capabilities to filter into groups that fit someoneâ€™s preferences, and can display search results as pins on map. Additionally users can start conversations and DM groups for more information, save posts that they like, and create events that will appear at the top of any search within a 15 mile radious for the span of a day.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Mobile:**
This app could have a DM feature and also by making it portable you don't need to have access to your computer for things like travel etc
- **Story:**
This app has a lot of value becuase not only will it promote being active and excersie but it could be a great tool for meeting new people and making friends
- **Market:**
This app wouldn't have an overly large user base but since there is no centralized version of this to the people who do pick up sports this would be a huge benefit. To the individual it gives them access to finding groups and for groups it gives them a tool to find new people
- **Habit:**
This app wouldn't be overly habit forming, it likely wouldn't be heavily used because it only promotes use until someone finds groups they like
- **Scope:**
This App should be reasonable to complete by the end of the designated time, the two hard parts would be implementing a filter option and DM option. If I have time I can also create a map representation of group locations or create a calendar/notifications fofr things.
