## Overview
### Description
Pickup app, groups can post a synopsis about who they are, what sport, where, when, intensity, a short bio then the app has search capabilities to filter into groups that fit someoneâ€™s preferences (possibly display locations on a map?) (Possibly a DM capability)

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Mobile:**
This app could have a DM feature and also by making it portable you don't need to have access to your computer for things like travel etc
- **Story:**
This app has a lot of value becuase not only will it promote being active and excersie but it could be a great tool for meeting new people and making friends
- **Market:**
This app wouldn't have an overly large user base but since there is no centralized version of this to the people who do pick up sports this would be a huge benefit. To the individual it gives them access to finding groups and for groups it gives them a tool to find new people
- **Habit:**
This app wouldn't be overly habit forming, it likely wouldn't be heavily used because it only promotes use until someone finds groups they like
- **Scope:**
This App should be reasonable to complete by the end of the designated time, the two hard parts would be implementing a filter option and DM option. If I have time I can also create a map representation of group locations or create a calendar/notifications fofr things.
